Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers that has many interesting mathematical properties. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, who studied and wrote about it in the 17th century. Pascal's Triangle starts with a single number 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding adjacent numbers from the previous row. Here's an example of the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle:

```
         1
        1 1
       1 2 1
      1 3 3 1
     1 4 6 4 1
    1 5 10 10 5 1
   1 6 15 20 15 6 1
```

Some key properties and patterns of Pascal's Triangle are as follows:

1. Binomial Coefficients: The numbers in Pascal's Triangle are also known as binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle represents the coefficient of the corresponding term in the expansion of the binomial expression (a + b)^n, where n is the row number and the exponent of the binomial.

2. Symmetry: Pascal's Triangle exhibits symmetry. Each row is a palindrome, meaning that the numbers are the same when read from left to right and right to left.

3. Diagonals: The diagonals of Pascal's Triangle have interesting properties. The numbers along a diagonal represent the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of (a + b)^(n-k), where k is the column number.

4. Sum of Rows: The sum of the numbers in each row of Pascal's Triangle is a power of 2. For example, the sum of the numbers in the 4th row (1 3 3 1) is 2^4.

5. Fibonacci Sequence: The Fibonacci sequence can be found as a pattern within Pascal's Triangle. Adding the numbers along a diagonal produces the Fibonacci sequence.

6. Combinations: Pascal's Triangle can be used to calculate combinations. The number in the nth row and kth column represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to their order.

Pascal's Triangle has applications in various areas of mathematics, such as algebra, combinatorics, probability, and number theory. It is also used in fields like computer science, cryptography, and data analysis. Its patterns and properties make it a fascinating and useful tool in various mathematical and computational contexts.
